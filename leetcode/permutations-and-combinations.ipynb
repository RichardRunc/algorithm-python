    "[Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-longest-special-substring-that-occurs-thrice-i/solutions/2585817/mei-ju-xian-xing-fu-za-du-by-tsreaper-978p/)\n",

    "You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string \"abc\" is not special, whereas the strings \"ddd\", \"zz\", and \"f\" are special.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"aaaa\"\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is \"aa\": substrings \"aaaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaa\".\n",
    "It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"abcdef\"\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"abcaba\"\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is \"a\": substrings \"abcaba\", \"abcaba\", and \"abcaba\".\n",
    "It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.\n",

    "Upon analyzing the code,we discovery that recording all length strings consisting of the same single word is unnecessary. A more efficient approach is to only record the occurrence count of the longest string.\n",
