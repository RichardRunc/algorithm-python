    "You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"leetscode\", dictionary = [\"leet\",\"code\",\"leetcode\"]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: \"leet\" from index 0 to 3 and \"code\" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"sayhelloworld\", dictionary = [\"hello\",\"world\"]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: \"hello\" from index 3 to 7 and \"world\" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.\n",
