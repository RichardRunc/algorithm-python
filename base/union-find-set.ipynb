    "UNION-FIND-SET is a common data structure in algorithms ued to connect vertices in a graph that can be union by a valid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Union-Find-Set algorithm provides two main operation:\n",
    "1. Union: Merge two subsets into a single subset\n",
    "2. find Determine which subset a particuler element belongs to.\n",
    "The Union-Find data structure is commonly used in various algorithms and problems, such as Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph and in implementing efficient algorithms for connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple explanation of the basic operations in a Union-Find set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: Each element starts as its own subset. This means that the initial state has each element in its own group, and the parent of each element is itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find operation: Given an element, you find the representative (root) of the subset to which it belongs. This operation is often implemented with path compression, where the paths to the root are shortened during the find operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Union operation: Given two elements, you merge the subsets to which they belong. This can be done by making one element the parent of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Union-Find data structure is often implemented with two optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Union by Rank: Attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree to keep the tree depth small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path Compression: During the Find operation, make each node on the find path point directly to the root. This helps in flattening the tree structure, reducing the time complexity of future find operations.\n"
