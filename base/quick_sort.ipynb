    "# quick sort\n",
    "QuickSort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It was developed by Tony Hoare in 1960. The basic idea behind QuickSort is to select a pivot element from the array and partition the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n"
